This repository contains code for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The EDA functions include:
Displaying the first few and last few rows of the dataset using head() and tail() functions.
Obtaining summary statistics of the dataset using the describe() function.
Checking the shape of the dataset using the shape attribute.
Identifying missing values in the dataset using the isnull() function.
Summing up the missing values in each column using the isnull().sum() function.

Graphs generated during EDA:
Age Distribution by Passenger Class and Survival: Visualizes the distribution of passengers' ages by passenger class and survival status.

Survival Rate by Gender: Shows the survival rate of passengers based on their gender.

Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard: Illustrates the survival rate by the number of siblings/spouses aboard.

Survival Rate by Passenger Class: Displays the survival rate based on the passenger class.

Distribution of Passengers Ages: Represents the distribution of passengers' ages using a histogram.
